## 🎮 **Game Overview**

### General Concept  
In *Survival Challenge in the Wild*, players must navigate an untamed wilderness filled with limited resources, environmental hazards, and unpredictable challenges. The goal is simple: **survive**. From building shelters to scavenging for food and water, every decision impacts the player’s journey and ultimate success.  

### Storyline  
The player takes on the role of a lone survivor of a plane crash. Stranded in a remote location—either a deserted island or deep within the Amazon rainforest—the player must adapt to their surroundings, gather resources, and overcome obstacles to survive. Along the way, the player encounters wildlife, changing weather conditions, and mysterious clues that may lead to salvation.

## 🌟 **Features**

### Core Gameplay Mechanics:
- **Resource Collection**: Gather water, edible plants, wood, and stones to craft tools, construct shelters, and survive.  
- **Crafting and Building**: Create essential tools (e.g., spears, axes) and build shelters for protection against the elements and predators.  
- **Health and Stamina Management**: Monitor your character's well-being by maintaining adequate hydration, nutrition, and rest. Poor management may lead to injuries or exhaustion.

- **Water Purification Puzzle**: Match and organize elements to purify contaminated water sources.  
- **Wildlife Encounters**: Quick-reaction scenarios to scare off or evade predators.  

### Advanced Mechanics:
- **Inventory Management**: Limited storage space requires strategic decisions about which items to keep or discard.  
- **Survival Journal**: Track discovered resources, safe zones, hidden paths, and clues for potential escape.  
- **Progressive Difficulty**: As players advance, challenges increase with more complex tasks and tougher environmental conditions.  

### Rules and Constraints:
- **One Life Only**: If the player dies from hunger, dehydration, or wildlife attack, the game restarts.  
- **Day-Night Cycle**: Nighttime brings increased danger and reduced visibility, necessitating torches or fire for safety.
